# Brackeys Godot Beginner Tutorial

## Licensing

- CC0: Completely free to use with no requirement to credit.

## Nodes

- To make anything in Godot we use Nodes.
- Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game.
- Making a game in Godot is combining and extending Nodes to get the result we're looking for. 

## Scenes

- Allow us to bundle together Nodes into reusable packages.
- Nesting: Putting Scenes inside of other Scenes.
- If you update the Scene, it automatically updates everywhere that Scene is being used.
- Scene Tree: All the Nodes and Scenes in our game resemble a tree-like structure. The Node at the beginning of the tree is called "Root".
